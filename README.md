# camera_geometry
Assignment is about the Camera Geometry.

Have a look at Forsyth & Ponce's book and Zisserman and Hartley's Book (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/hzbook/). Chapter on epipolar geometry is freely available.

Please read the assignment and have the questions ready.

We have only covered what are Calibration matrix, Projection matrix and Fundamental Matrix  etc... but we still have to talk about how to recover it. That we can only do after you have read properly about camera geometry.
